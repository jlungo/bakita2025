Maselle Chief Executive TEMESA December, 2020 i TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Tanzania Electrical, Mechanical and Electronics Services Agency (TEMESA) is a public entity established by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (URT) by the Government Notice Number 254 published on 26th August, 2005 to take over the functions which were previously undertaken by the then Electrical and Mechanical (E&M) Division of the Ministry of Works. The Agency was created in the spirit of Act of No 30 of 1997, which was to improve services and increase both effectiveness and efficiency of operations. The overall objective of the Agency is to provide efficient and effective electrical, mechanical and electronics’ services as well as reliable and safe ferry services to the general public. The Agency also aims to provide quality and reliable services related to the hiring of equipments to government institutions and the general public. In order for the Agency to effectively undertake its established mandate, it is required, among others, to prepare Strategic Plans showing its strategic directions for the period of five years. It is in this spirit the current Strategic Plan which runs from 2020/21 to 2025/26 is prepared. This Strategic Plan has been developed using participatory approach involving all heads of Sections and Units of the Agency. In particular, this Plan outlines issues of importance relating to the development of engineering services provided by TEMESA by detailing current and future potentials and strategic direction for ensuring efficient engineering services in the next five years. This Strategic Plan assumes that financial and non-financial resources will be available and appropriate and favourable legislative and regulatory environment as well as stable and harmonious relationship between the Agency and the parent Ministry and other key stakeholders will continue to exist. It also assumes that social, political and economic stability in the country will continue to prevail. Furthermore, this Plan assumes that effective internal arrangement and mechanisms will be instituted and strengthened and the staff, management and members of the Ministerial Advisory Board (MAB) will continue to effectively cooperate in order to realize the Agency’s Strategic Objectives. Based on the priority issues identified during the situational analysis and the evaluation of the previous strategic plan, the vision of the Agency in the next five years is ‘To be an efficient and innovative organisation that provides engineering services in Tanzania Mainland that focused on customer satisfaction’. Also, the mission statement of the Agency for the next five ii TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 years is: ‘To provide reliable, safe and high quality electrical, mechanical and electronic services, ferry services and hiring out plant and equipment using modern technologies’ In the next five years of this Strategic Plan, TEMESA will be guided by six (6) core values. These are customer centricity, integrity, teamwork, professionalism, accountability, and transparency. Implementation of this Strategic Plan will be carried out under the seven (7) strategic objectives. These are reducing non-communicable diseases, HIV and AIDS infections and improve supportive services; enhance implementation of National Anti-corruption Strategy and reduce corruption incidences; improve mobilization, management and accountability of TEMESA financial resources; improve TEMESA Engineering services and infrastructure; improve TEMESA Business processes and support services; Oversight of TEMESA Operations and efficiency continuously monitored; and improve management and accountability of human resources. Each of these strategic objectives has strategies, targets and corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These facilitate effective implementation and evaluation of the stated strategic objectives. To ensure that these strategic objectives are met, the Plan also presents the result framework which includes description on the development goal, linkages with national planning frameworks, result chain, result framework matrix, and monitoring, review and evaluation plan. It also presents the reporting plan which provides mechanisms for internal and external reporting arrangements. Whilst it is essential to strengthen the mechanisms which would ensure attainment of the Agency’s strategic objectives and its overall development objective (goal), this Strategic Plan underscores the unique contributions of the various stakeholders from both public and private sector) on the same. Therefore, it appeals for maximum cooperation from all stakeholders. It is the expectation of TEMESA that this Plan will serve the interests of all of its stakeholders and the nation in general. iii TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 ABBREVIATIONS CAG CIA DBSS DMTS DFOC CSM E&M FYDP FAM GTA HRAM ICT IPSAS JV KPIs LAN LHIV LGA LSM MAB MDAs MoFP MoWT MUSE OTR NAOT PBG PCCB PO-PSM PPA PPP PPRA Controller and Auditor General Chief Internal Auditor Director of Business Support Services Director of Maintenance and Technical Services Director of Ferry Operations and Constructions Consultancy Services Manager Electrical and Mechanical Division in the Ministry of Works Five Years Development Plan Finance and Accounts Manager Government Transport Agency Human Resource and Administrations Manager Information and Telecommunication Technology International Public Sector Accounting Standards Joint Venture Key Performance Indicators Local Area Network Living with HIV Local Government Authority Legal Services Manager Ministerial Advisory Board Ministry, Departments and Agencies Ministry of Finance and Planning Ministry of Works and Transport Mfumo wa Malipo Serikalini Office of Treasurer National Audit Office of Tanzania Plan and Budget Guideline Prevention and Combating Corruption Bureau President Office-Public Service Management Public Procurement Act Public Private Partnership Public Procurement Regulatory Authority vi TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 PMM PSP PSRS SDGs SWOC TANROADS TASAC TEMESA TEP URT WAN Procurement Management Manager Private Sector Participation Public Service Recruitment Secretariat Sustainable Development Goals Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Challenges Tanzania Roads Agency Tanzania Shipping Agencies Corporation Tanzania Electrical, Mechanical and Electronics Services Agency TANROADS Equipment Unit United Republic of Tanzania Wide Area Network vii TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 SECTION ONE INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Information of TEMESA The Tanzania Electrical, Mechanical and Electronics Services Agency (TEMESA) was established by the Government Notice Number 254 published on 26th August, 2005 to take over the functions which were previously undertaken by the then Electrical and Mechanical (E&M) Division of the Ministry of Works. The Agency was created in the spirit of Act of No 30 of 1997, which was to improve services and increase both effectiveness and efficiency of operations. The overall objective of the Agency is to provide efficient and effective electrical, mechanical and electronics’ services as well as reliable and safe ferry services to the general public. The Agency also aims to provide quality and reliable services related to the hiring of equipments to government institutions and the general public. In particular, the Agency was created to achieve the following objectives: i] To improve the delivery of public services; ii] To create an enabling environment, conducive to efficient and effective management iii] To improve the quality of services which were previously being provided by the Electrical and Mechanical (E&M) Division in the Ministry iv] To promote the potential for the continuous improvement of the services to the satisfaction of the customers and the public 1.2 An Overview of the Assignment In order to exercise its establishment mandate and functions, TEMESA has put in place three main functional divisions, namely, Maintenance and Technical Services Division, Business Support Services Division, and Ferry Operations and Constructions Division. In order to ensure that these divisions work effectively towards achievement of the agency’s missions and visions, the agency needs to develop its strategic plan. This is a tool that provides overall guidance to the agency on how it may achieve its missions and visions in medium term of 5 years. In this regard, the existing strategic plan that covers a period of 5 years from 2016/17 to 2020/21 has come to an end. Therefore, in order to ensure that the strategic direction of the agency for the next five years is established, the Agency has decided to prepare its Five Years Strategic Plan which covers 2021/22 to 2025/26 . 1 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 1.3 Approach Used Various activities have been undertaken in connection to the preparation of the Agency’s Strategic Plan. For instance, as initial steps, the management performed the following reviews and surveys: i] ii] iii] Performance review of the existing strategic plan 2016/17 – 2020/21; Internal assessment of the existing strategic plan 2016/17 – 2020/21; and Stakeholders’ analysis. The above reviews and surveys helped to provide the basic information about the Agency, its performance and perception of its key stakeholders on its performance. This information provided a foundation for carrying out situational analysis of the Agency. Apart from critical review of the above mentioned management reviews and surveys reports, review of the National Development Planning Frameworks documents such as Tanzania Development Vision 2025, The FYDP III, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), The President’s speech when inaugurating the Parliament on 13/11/2020 and Chama cha Mapinduzi Manifesto were carried out. These documents provided basic guidelines for the preparation of the Strategic Plan. In addition to these, Plan and Budget Guideline (PBG), this is the document that provides specific guideline for preparation of plans and budget for LGAs and MDAs was also reviewed. The review of all these documents was necessary in order to ensure that the prepared strategic plan is in line with the comprehensive government plans and follows the relevant guidelines which govern its preparation. After review of the relevant documents, the actual tasks of the preparation of the Strategic Plan began. Using participatory approach, the following tasks were carried out in connection to the preparation of the Agency’s Strategic Plan: i] ii] Understanding approaches followed in the preparation of a strategic plan. Brainstorming and developing the contents of the Agency’s strategic plan which include:  Analysis of the Agency’s Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Challenges (SWOC);  Identification of the critical issues,  Development of strategic objectives, strategies, targets, and key performance indicators 2 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26  Development of monitoring and evaluation approaches iii] iv] Filling relevant particulars in both Strategic Plan Matrix and Monitoring and Evaluation Matrix; and Validating all details included in the Proposed Strategic Plan of the Agency. The above approaches resulted into Draft Strategic Plan which was presented to the Ministerial Advisory Board (MAB) for further comments. Therefore, this Final Strategic Plan for the Agency has incorporated all comments provided by MAB. 1.4 Layout of the Strategic Plan This plan is organized into four sections. Section One introduces the Agency’s Strategic Plan. It covers background information of the Agency, an overview of the assignment, and approach used to undertake the assignment under consideration. Section Two assesses performance of the previous strategic plan and presents situational analysis. In particular, it presents strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and challenges (SWOC) which are facing or likely to face TEMESA. It also highlights the critical issues which need to be considered in the next 5 years. Section Three presents the vision, mission, core values, strategic objectives, strategies and targets of the Agency. Section Four, which is the last section, presents the results framework that provides detailed monitoring and evaluation framework. 3 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 SECTION TWO SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS 2.1 Introduction This section covers a detailed review of situational analysis. In particular, the section presents evaluation of the previous strategic plan, stakeholders’ analysis and SWOC (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Challenges) analysis. These three key parts of the section are then used to deduce the critical issues that gear this new strategic plan. 2.2 Evaluation of Previous Strategic Plan This sub-section presents the objectives of the previous strategic plan and the extent of their implementation. 2.2.1 Objectives of the Previous Strategic Plan The previous Strategic Plan (2016/17 - 2020/21) had the following seven (7) objectives: i] HIV/AIDS infections reduced and supportive services improved; ii] Effective implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategies enhanced. iii] Financial sustainability enhanced, iv] Engineering services and its related infrastructure improved, v] Business processes and support services improve; vi] Good governance and accountability enhanced; vii] Management of human resources improved. 2.2.2 Overall Implementation Status of the Previous Strategic Plan This is a performance review of objectives and related targets in terms of achievements and challenges for each objective as stipulated in the 2016/17 – 2020/21 Strategic Plan. The significant achievement experienced in the objective of financial sustainability, in this regard, the Agency has increased its revenue at the average rate of 15 percent annually, it should be noted that the average increase rate of revenue is contributed largely with all services recorded an average growth rate above 15 percent annually, except ferry services that has been stagnant for the planning period. The total revenue generation has increased by 50 percent compared to the baseline value, as well as total expenditure increased by 62 percent as compared to baseline value. Important thing noted is that, the Agency currently have reduced dependency from government subvention as use its own sources of revenue to 4 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 finance its other charges (OC) by 100 percent and managed to finance some development projects. Although, the Agency still have a problem in debt management as yet not improved. It is also reviewed other aspects such as organization structure, vision and mission of the Agency. In reviewing the organization structure the Agency revealed that, the organization has the following shortfalls; i] Some production centres are missing on the structure; MT Depot, Corp. Sole, Magogoni – Kigamboni Ferry Crossing and GTA ii] Uncoordinated Reporting hierarch which negatively affect performance of the Agency. For example; among of the responsibilities of DMTS and DFOC is to supervise production centres while they are not reporting to him/her. iii] Head of Marketing and Public Relations should be either a Principal Information or Marketing Officer, but the Org. Structure requires only Principal Information Officer to head the Unit. iv] Titles of regional sections heads are not specified The mission and vision have played a critical role in setting the keynote for TEMESA that, as the defining context, explicitly and implicitly influenced the objectives at the department and unit levels. As TEMESA looks to the future, the vision and mission in the current strategic plan should continue to serve the Agency well as its base-line framework. This situation it compel the Agency to insert more efforts to fulfil their mission and vision. 5 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 6 Table 1: PERFORMANCE REVIEW Objective Code OBJECTIVE TARGET ACHIEVEMENTS CONSTRAINTS/ CHALLENGE WAY FORWADS A HIV/AIDS infections reduced and supportive services improved 2 Awareness campaigns/ programs of the spread of HIV/AIDS conducted 4 Awareness campaign conducted and 159 staff sensitized on HIV/AIDS infections Weak Coordination between regions and HQ on HIV/AIDS awareness campaign  Ensure coordination on corruption awareness campaign  Conduct sensitization on HIV/AIDS Care and supportive services to staff living with HIV/AIDS provided 15 staff provided with nutrition foods and support services Unwillingness of staff living with HIV/AIDS to expose themselves Strengthen awareness campaign on HIV/AIDS testing B Effective implementation of the National Anti-corruption Strategies enhanced 2 awareness campaigns/programs on the national Ant-Corruption Strategy conducted 4 Awareness campaign conducted and 159 staff sensitized on corruption issues Weak Coordination between regions and HQ on Anti-corruption awareness campaign conducted.  Ensure coordination on corruption awareness campaign.  Conduct sensitization on corruption issues Complaints handling mechanism institutionalized No complaints handling mechanism established although 27 complaint desks introduced out of 31 production centres Weak coordination between Regional offices and TEMESA HQ  Establish complaints desks in remained centres  Formalize complaints handling mechanism TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 7 Objective Code OBJECTIVE TARGET ACHIEVEMENTS CONSTRAINTS/ CHALLENGE WAY FORWADS 10 meetings of integrity Agency conducted 8 integrity meetings conducted comply with agreed meetings schedule C Financial Sustainability Enhanced Revenue from own sources increased by 15% annually The Agency has increased its revenue at the average rate of 15 percent annually, whereby all services recorded an average growth rate above 15 percent annually, except ferry services that has been stagnant for the planning period as follows: i] Revenue collection from ferry services decreased from Tshs. 14,035,654,633.00 in FY 2015/2016 to Tshs. 13,368,117,020.00 in FY 2019/20 which is equal to 5% decrease ii] Revenue collection from engineering maintenance increased from Tshs. 12,305,652,999.00 in FY 2015/2016 to Tshs. 30,237,485,679 in FY 2019/2020 which is equal to 1.

This involves, among others, the appropriate arrangement through instituting effective and working internal controls which would ensure smooth undertaking of TEMESA operations. The current situation at TEMESA shows that business processes and supportive services such as Information and Communication Technology (ICT), marketing, accounting and finance need some improvement. This will enable the Agency to effectively and efficiently serve its client. In order to improve business processes and supportive services in the next five years of the life of Strategic Plan, the Agency is expected to employ many strategies including the following: Strategies i] ii] iii] iv] Enhance ICT and Statistics activities Improve ICT systems Strengthen marketing and public relations activities Increase customer base v] Review and develop Internal audit documents vi] Acquire and maintain office facilities and equipment vii] viii] ix] Acquire transport facilities Facilitate application of sectorial policies Develop new operational documents and review of existing ones x] Strengthen efficiency of Workshop operation xi] Procure office facilities and equipment. xii] Comply to International and National requirements for a consulting Firm 39 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 xiii] Undertake routine legal service activities.

Being a public sector, TEMESA needs to follow practices which are in line with good governance and accountability. This has potential of increasing public confidence on the Agency’s dealings which in turn could be benefited in terms of increased clients and public support. Therefore, 41 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 in order to enhance operations and efficiency, the following strategies are expected to be employed in the next five years of this Strategic Plan: Strategies i] ii] Strengthen oversight roles Ferry operations comply with TASAC requirements Targets i] ii] 4 MAB, 4 Audit Agency and 2 workers council Agency meetings facilitated every year up to June, 2026. All vessels complied with TASAC requirements every year up to June, 2026 Key performance Indicator (KPI’s): i] ii] Number of meetings conducted Number of vessels awarded seaworthiness certificates and registration certificate 3.5.7 Strategic Objective G: Management and accountability of human resources improved Rationale: Management of human resource is critical to any organization. TEMESA is not an exception. In order to effectively undertake its established mandate, TEMESA has to take all necessary measures to ensure effective and efficient management of its human resources. Since the Agency has staff stationed in all regions of Tanzanian Mainland and these are of different cadre, there is a need to ensure that the management of the Agency’s human resources is improved and made accountable. In order to achieve this objective, the Agency is expected to use various strategies including the following: Strategies i] Coordinate budgeting and budgetary control 42 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 ii] iii] iv] Strengthen operationalization of Open Performance Review and Appraisal System [OPRAS] Strengthen capacity building programs Improve staff welfare v] Bridge the gap of permanent staff vi] Develop and review Human Resource Operational procedures and guidelines vii] Improve staff performance Targets i] ii] iii] iv] Personal Emolument budget prepared and implemented annually by June, 2026 OPRAS awareness, implementation and Evaluation to all staff facilitated by June, 2026. 547 staff attended training, seminar and workshops by June, 2026.

In particular, the section shows the beneficiaries of the Agency’s services, the overall goal (Development Objective), links between strategic objectives and National Planning Frameworks and result framework matrix. The section further presents monitoring plan, the planned reviews, evaluation plan and reporting plan. The section is generally situated to ensure effective achievement of the strategic objectives of the envisaged Strategic Plan. 4.2 Development Objective (Goal) The overall objective of TEMESA is to improve quality of engineering services and related infrastructure. In particular, TEMESA envision providing the improved quality mechanical, electrical, electronic, ferry and equipment hire services to its client. In order to achieve this goal (development objective), TEMESA believes that the cooperation of key players (stakeholders) is very important. Also, the achievement of this goal will be influenced by various factors prime amongst which are level of financial and non-financial resources available, staff and management commitment and the directly and indirect Government support. 4.3 Beneficiaries of the Agency’s Services The main beneficiaries of the Agency services are clients (customers) who receive the engineering services and related infrastructure. These are mainly divided into three groups. The first group include public sector entities, namely, Ministries, Independent Departments and Agencies. These are required by law to use the Agency services for all their mechanical, electrical and electronics works. The second group include private entities which receive the Agency’s services directly or indirectly or used by the Agency to provide services to other public sector entities. The third group include general public who consume/use services such as ferry services provided by the Agency. In the next five (5) years of life of this Strategic Plan, the Agency will improve delivery of its services for the betterment of these 45 TEMESA STRATEGIC PLAN 2020/21 - 2025/26 beneficiaries. 4.4 Linkage with National Planning Frameworks This Strategic Plan has seven strategic objectives which contribute to Tanzania Development Vision 2025, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the National Five Years Development Plan goals, the ruling party Election Manifesto 2020 - 2025, and other sectorial policies and programs. Specifically, the Objectives contribute to the ruling party Election Manifesto 2020 – 2025 (section 57j page 83 – 84) in place to strengthen ferry services through construction and rehabilitation of ferries, also construction of ferry ramps. 4.5 Results Chain TEMESA’s Results Chain consists of outcomes, outputs, activities and inputs. A combination of the Objectives and Targets in the Strategic Plan and Activities and Inputs in the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) forms TEMESA’s Results Chain. The basic assumption is that, there is causal linkage in the various elements of the Agency’s Results Chain. The inputs (utilization of resources) will lead to achievement of the activities, which will contribute to achievement of targets. Achievement of targets (outputs) will lead to achievement of objectives. Achievement of TEMESA’s Development Objective (Goal) in the medium term will contribute to the achievement of the ruling party Election Manifesto 2020 – 2025 and the National Five Years Development Plan goals. This chain of results will justify TEMESA’s use of the tax payer’s money into the various projects and thus contribute to the development of the country through improved TEMESA engineering services and infrastructure. 4.6 The Result Framework Matrix This matrix contains TEMESA overall Development Objective (Goal), objective codes, medium term objectives, intermediate outcomes and outcome indicators. It envisions how the Development Objective will be achieved and how the results will be measured.
