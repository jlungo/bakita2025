Minister for Agriculture, Hon. Hussein Bashe (MP), has warned against the common practice of discarding certain avocado produce without providing alternative applications. He emphasized that this approach diminishes the potential for utilizing these avocados in the creation of other valuable products. “Avocado serves as a backbone of the horticulture, thus it is a crop that plays as a sub-sector because horticulture has diverse array of crops in it,” said Minister Bashe explaining the reason for having the First National Avocado Stakeholders Meeting. The meeting was hosted by the Cereals and Other Produce Regulatory Authority (COPRA) on 4th of April 2025, in Dodoma. Other reputable partner who collaborated with COPRA in effectuating the meeting is the Tanzania Horticultural Association (TAHA). In his address, Minister Bashe said that the Sixth Phase Government's commitment to prioritizing the avocado sector, alongside other competitive crops, has been instrumental in launching several initiatives that have advanced the avocado industry. He highlighted one such initiative as the establishment of a plant health authority, now referred to as the Tanzania Plant Health and Pesticides Authority (TPHPA). “We have initiated an irrigation subsidy program in the avocado sector by acquiring 18 drilling machines for irrigation wells, which will support avocado farmers nationwide. This infrastructure development will contribute to the longevity of avocado trees,” said Minister Bashe. As to the radiation fee on avocados, he mentioned that it is currently under review, with the possibility of its removal being considered. Currently, Tanzania ranks second in avocado production in the African continent, alongside other successful producers like Kenya, Ethiopia, and South Africa. In terms of market distribution, Tanzania exports approximately 40% of its avocados to Europe, 30% to India, and around 19% to countries in the Middle East. Participants included Farmers, Exporters, Development Partners, esteemed Members of Parliament, Private Sector, and other pertinent Stakeholders within the avocado industry.
