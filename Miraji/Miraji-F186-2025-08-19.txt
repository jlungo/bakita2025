Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Hon. David Silinde (MP) unvailed the Government’s agricultural transformative plan in fulfilling farmers needs through policies enforcements and programs with the establishment of Tanzania Agriculture Growth Corridors, the Presidential Agriculture Advisory Council, the Agriculture Transformation Office (ATO), including a youth and women program under the Build a Better Tomorrow program - (BBT). The launching ceremony took place on 4 February 2025, whereby the Norwegian Embassy and the Alliance for Green Revolution in Africa - AGRA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to support Tanzania’s Agriculture Transformation Office (ATO) that would roll out the agriculture growth corridors of Tanzania (AGCOT) model- expand the territory. Hon.Silinde said that the signed MoU aligns with the previous MoU betwen Tanzanian Government and the Government of the Kingdom of Norway signed on 14th February 2024 whereby some areas of cooperation included supporting private sector investments and access to financial services, especially for local small medium food producing enterprises, strengthening the role of farmer organizations and cooperatives, and the opportunities of women and youth in the agri-food sector. The total cost of the project is NOK 15M which is equivalent to 1,348,466 USD for 3 years (2025-2027) and is expected to remove agricultural regulatory barriers (including export barries) to attract private sector investment and scaling up of SAGCOT model to agriculture growth corridors of Tanzania (AGCOT), an inclusive economic growth, improved food security, poverty reduction and agriculture commercialization. The Government’s plan aims at supporting agricultural land and infrastructure expansions to boost productivity while ensuring food security, research development, extension services, food reserve enhancement, expansion of irrigation schemes, seed sector development; and commercialization of the agricultural sector. In cementing the historical partnership between the two countries, Norwegian Ambassador to Tanzania H.E. Tone Tinnes said that Norway will continue to support more productive projects in Tanzania in empowering small scale farmers.
