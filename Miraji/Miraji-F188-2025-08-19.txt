The Minister for Agriculture, Hon. Hussein Bashe (MP) engaged in a discussion with Ms. Michelle Kilpin, Managing Director for the Tanzania Breweries PLC (TBL) Managing Director, at his office in Dodoma on 29 January 2025 in respect to opportunities in the agricultural sector. Minister Bashe encouraged TBL to consider expanding its investments, specifically in the research and cultivation of malt barley seed varieties. He highlighted the significant potential of the Southern Regions such as Njombe, Iringa, and surrounding areas for this initiative, noting the potential benefits for both raw material production and the livelihoods of local farmers. Furthermore, Minister Bashe advocated for TBL's investment in large-scale block farms in the scope of Build a Better Tomorrow program (BBT) dedicated to barley production in Dodoma and Chunya. He underscored the critical role of scientific research, optimized crop production, and the development of requisite infrastructure to support these endeavors. TBL, a prominent brewing company with established operations in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Mwanza, Mbeya, and Kilimanjaro, has a demonstrated commitment to supporting local farmers. Their existing initiatives include research, seed provision, and facilitating access to essential agricultural inputs. This meeting served to further solidify the commitment of both the Ministry and TBL in strengthening the agricultural sector in Tanzania. The meeting also included the participation of TBL Corporate Affairs Director, Ms. Neema Temba; TBL Finance Director, Mr. Avito Swai; and TDL (a subsidiary of TBL) Commercial Director, Mr. Brett Rudis.
